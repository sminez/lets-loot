Character Classes
=================
Different classes should have noticeable differences in Gameplay

Focuses
- Combat
- Exploration
- Survival
- Loot
- Development

Party dynamics should play out as the crawl progresses: you only control
one character but you get to decide who to adventure with by joining or
creating a party. Joining a party is free and you get an upfront adventuring
but you have no say over the expedition goal or other party members. Starting
an adventure costs money but you have complete control.
Previous - non-dead - characters can be recruited on future runs and will
potentially venture out themselves. You can re-use a previous character at any
time rather than creating a new one.

The default player role is as guild member so character creation takes the form
of the guild application process. Upgrading the guild hall allows for better
equipment, more varied pair quests (party leaders hiring guild members) and new
character types as the guild expands its charter and allows more varied members.

The guild hall should be explorable and feel a bit like a trope school canteen
with all of the various factions sharding off to their own areas.
