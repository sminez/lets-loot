# Guild Master
_Explore the mysterious Archive of Nayhm-Teb'd_

```
From the Guild Hall in town, join up with a party and set out to explore
the mysterious Archive with its friendly - yet mysterious - curators: the
Curators.
Will you be a daring Knight? An inquisitive trainee archivist? A travelling
accountant for hire? Only time - and your selection at the character creation
screen - will tell.

...mysterious!
```

Take on the role of a guild master trying to make a living by exploring the
mysterious Archive of Nayhm-Teb'd. While you _can_ go adventuring yourself it's
usually better to get some more...expendible associates to do that for you.

From lowly beginings raise yourself up to the dissy heights of meagerness and
minor brand recognition as you strive for ever less offputting surroundings.
