Human:
    description: >
      Humans spend their short lives looking for adventure. The appearance
      of the Archive and the daily flood of information, artifacts and new
      species that pours out of it attracts the curious and rewards the
      skillfull.

Halfling:
    description: >
        Halflings have always been here but their tendancy to keep to themselves
        and stay out of sight kept their existance a secret until now. The
        arival of the Archive races prompted halflings to make themselves known
        to the Humans and now they walk freely among us.

Dwarf:
    description: >
        The Dwarves were the first new race that the Humans encountered in the
        Archive. Their skill with machinery matched only with their temper and
        ability to take a hit. They have taken a keen interest in firearms and
        Dwarven muskets are some of the finest to be found.

Elf:
    description: >
        The Elves of the Archive are an ancient and arogant race. It is not
        known if their claims to have built the archive are true or not but
        they certainly seem to know a lot about its construction and contents.
        Elegant, beutiful and deadly, the Elves tend to avoid socialising with
        the other races whenever possible.

Dweller:
    description: >
        Dwellers are a curious race. Their presence in the Archive was
        noticed almost immediately but contact with them took many years.
        They are highly secretive and adept at evading foes in the archive,
        to which they seem to be connected in some way...
